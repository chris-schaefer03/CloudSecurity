# CloudSecurity

This project defines secure AWS infrastructure using Terraform, focusing on best practices for managing cloud resources. The setup includes an encrypted and versioned S3 bucket as well as IAM configurations for secure access control.

‚úÖ **Goals & What I'm Learning**

I'm using this project to gradually build my understanding of secure Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices. So far, I've been learning how to:

- Use the AWS provider in Terraform
- Create and encrypt S3 buckets with AWS KMS
- Enable versioning for object history and recovery
- Define IAM roles and attach policies for controlled access
- Work with variables and `jsonencode` in Terraform
